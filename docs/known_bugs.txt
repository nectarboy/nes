CPU:
- BRK is bugged (according to blarg instr_test v5)
- CPU timings are off (blarg instr_timing)
PPU:
- sprites overflow from bottom of screen to first scanline
possible culprit: prerender scanline being hardcoded as -1

-----------------------------------------
SUPER MARIO BROS: death jingle is flat (no sweep)
possible culprit: I DONT KNOW ;-;

TETRIS: '0' characters are a lil bit corrupted for some reason
possible culprit: MMC1, possibly smth with pages

DOUBLE DRAGON: the intro with the girl getting kidnapped flickers with the menu bar going up
possible culprit: ??? idk ??? maybe sprite 0 ?
