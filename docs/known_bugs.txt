CPU:
- The CPU runs slightly too slow i suspect?(Music sounds slightly slower to me)
- BRK is bugged (according to blarg instr_test v5)
- CPU timings are off (blarg instr_timing)

PPU:
- PPU timings are off (blarg says so)

APU:
- Audio playback is slightly offtune at higher frequencies
(this is intentional; as a tradeoff, audio is more stable and doesnt click nearly as often. idk how to fix the slight offtune but whatever)

MMC3:
- scanline counter is BUGGY woooooow

-----------------------------------------
[FIXED] SUPER MARIO BROS: death jingle fixed ^-^
cause: sweep div reload bug

[FIXED] SUPER MARIO BROS 2: jump sound fixed ^-^
cause: also sweep bug

[FIXED] TETRIS: '0' character fixed ^-^
cause: MMC1 overwrote chr rom

BATTLETOADS: graphical glitches
suspected: innacurate ppu timings ?? if the cpu timings seem ok it leaves 1 culprit left

DOUBLE DRAGON: the intro with the girl getting kidnapped flickers with the menu bar going up
suspected: cpu is somehow too slow to catch sprite 0 hitting ?? or maybe ppu too fast
could also be me missing openbus who knows lol

KIRBY'S ADVENTURE: status bar flickers
cause: scanline counter wow!!!
