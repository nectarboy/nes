# pooptendo !
This is a Nintendo Entertainment System but stuffed inside with horse manure.
That is why it will not work when you plug any games in it.

It is a phat WIP as you can prolly tell ...<br>
[Still, try it out ?](https://nectarboy.github.io/nes)

## what about it ?
Pooptendo kinda aims for cycle accuracy; i want most well known (and the fun) games to work, and the final boss is that (not fun) froggy game >:D

The CPU is made to be cycle accurate, though idk if its 100% correct.<br>
The PPU is emulated to the pixel level, though it is still being worked on, and i make some sacrifices sometimes for speed.
If issues show up though, (or if i manage to make it fast enough), ill do my best to make it as accurate as i can !
