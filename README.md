<h1 align='center'>Pooptendo</h1>

This is Pooptendo, a Nintendo Entertainment System but stuffed inside with horse manure.
Games may or may not work when you plug them into this Pooptendo.

Its a big WIP as you can prolly tell ... but some games work !<br>
[you can try it online :)](https://nectarboy.github.io/nes)

## what about it ?
Pooptendo kinda aims for cycle accuracy; i want most well known (and the fun) games to work, and the final boss is that difficult-to-emulate froggy game >:D

The CPU is cycle accurate, but there might be a few bugs lying around.<br>
The PPU is emulated to the pixel level, though i sometimes make small sacrifices for speed, and there are still some missing stuff.<br>
If issues show up though, (or if i manage to make it fast enough), i'll do my best to make it as accurate as i can :)
